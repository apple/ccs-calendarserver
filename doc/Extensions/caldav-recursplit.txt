             Smart Splitting of Recurring Events in CalDAV

Abstract

   This document defines an extension to CalDAV that allows calendar
   clients to split recurring events on the server in such a way as to
   preserve the original per-attendee data, such as alarms and
   participation status.

                       CalDAV Recurrence Splitting          January 2014


1.  Introduction

   Internet calendaring and scheduling standards are defined by
   iCalendar [RFC5545] and iTIP [RFC5546].  The CalDAV Access [RFC4791]
   standard defines a way to access calendar data stored on a server,
   and the CalDAV Scheduling [RFC6638] draft defines how scheduling
   occurs between users of a CalDAV server.

   When dealing with recurring events defined in iCalendar, it is often
   necessary for the organizer of the events to apply a change from one
   of the recurrence instances on into the future (e.g., add a new
   attendee part way through the series of meetings). iCalendar supports
   a "RANGE" property parameter on the "RECURRENCE-ID" property that
   allows for a "THIS-AND-FUTURE" change to an existing set of recurring
   events.  However, the "RANGE" behavior is not always implemented.
   Instead, clients split the recurring series into two separate events
   (different UIDs and thus different calendar object resources stored
   in a CalDAV calendar).  One series contains all the instances up to
   the point where the change is made, and the other contains all the
   instances from that point onwards.  Typically this is done by
   truncating the recurrence rule in the existing resource and creating
   a new resource for the ongoing recurrence.  However, when done that
   way, it results in any per-attendee data in the original resource for
   recurrence instances after the "split point" being lost - i.e.,
   attendee loose all their status for the ongoing instances.  What is
   more, due to the requirements of CalDAV scheduling, the "PARTSTAT"
   parameter on the "ATTENDEE" properties in the new calendar object
   resource will be forcibly reset to "NEEDS-ACTION", requiring
   attendees to re-accept/decline the ongoing recurrence series in the
   new calendar object resource.  This is obviously a poor user
   experience that needs to be corrected.

   This specification defines a new CalDAV POST request action that
   causes the server to split an existing calendar object resource
   containing a recurring event, into two pieces at a specified "split
   point", such that per-attendee data and attendee participation status
   is preserved in the new calendar object resource created by the
   split.  Once that is done, clients can then modify the new resource
   to make the actual "this-and-future" change that triggers the split.

   This specification does not cover the case of splitting of scheduled
   calendar data for attendees not hosted on the CalDAV server.
   Instead, existing existing procedures for sending iTIP messages have
   to be used to update the attendee data to account for the split,
   likely resulting in loss of per-attendee data.  A future extension to
   iTIP might be possible to address that, but is not covered here.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   When XML element types in the namespaces "DAV:" and
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:caldav" are referenced in this document
   outside of the context of an XML fragment, the string "DAV:" and
   "CALDAV:" will be prefixed to the element type names respectively.

   The namespace "http://calendarserver.org/ns/" is used for XML
   elements defined in this specification.  When XML element types in
   this namespace are referenced in this document outside of the context
   of an XML fragment, the string "CS:" will be prefixed to the element
   type names respectively.

   The prefix X-CALENDARSERVER- is used for all iCalendar properties,
   parameters and enumerated values defined in this extension.


3.  New behavior

   A server supporting the features described in this specification MUST
   include "calendarserver-recurrence-split" as a field in the DAV
   response header from an OPTIONS request on a calendar home
   collection.

   To split an existing calendar object resource containing a recurring
   event, a client issues an HTTP POST resource with the request-uri set
   to the URI of the calendar object resource.  The client also includes
   the following two URI query parameters:

   1.  "action" set to the value "split"

   2.  "rid" set to an iCalendar format DATE-TIME value in UTC
       ("YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ" style format).

   The "action" parameter is used to distinguish this operation from
   others that might be defined in the future for calendar object
   resources.  The "rid" parameter specified the UTC date-time where the
   split is to occur.  The actual split occurs at the next recurrence
   instance on or after the "rid" parameter value - the "split point".

   Client MUST include both parameters in the POST request and MUST
   ensure a valid date-time value is used.  The date-time value MUST NOT
   be earlier than the start time of the first instance of the
   recurrence set, and it MUST NOT be later than the start time of the



Daboo                                                           [Page 3]

                       CalDAV Recurrence Splitting          January 2014


   last instance of the recurrence set.  If the "rid" parameter value is
   not of the correct format or missing, the server MUST return a DAV:
   error response with the CALDAV:valid-rid-parameter pre-condition
   code.  If the "rid" parameter is valid, but outside of the allowed
   range, or the targeted calendar object resource is not recurring,
   then the server MUST return a DAV:error response with the CS:invalid-
   split pre-condition code.  The server MUST reject any attempt by an
   attendee to split their copy of a scheduled calendar object resource
   - only organizers are allowed to split events.

   Clients MAY include an HTTP "Prefer" request header including the
   value "return=representation" (see [I-D.snell-http-prefer]).  That
   instructs the server to return a WebDAV multistatus response
   containing two responses: one for the targeted resource and one for
   the new resource created as a result of the split.  The multistatus
   response MUST include the DAV:getetag and CALDAV:calendar-data
   properties for each resource.  In the absence of the "Prefer:
   return=representation" request header, the server MUST return an HTTP
   "Split-Component-URL" response header whose value is the URI of the
   new resource created as a result of the split.

   When a server receives a valid split request as described above, it
   does the equivalent of the following:

   1.  The existing resource is duplicated, preserving any per-user data
       such as alarms or transparency status.

   2.  The calendar data in the existing resource is modified as
       follows:

       A.  Any overridden components with a "RECURRENCE-ID" property
           value prior to the split point are removed.

       B.  Any "RDATE" or "EXDATE" property values prior to the split
           point are removed.

       C.  Any "RRULE" property that only generates instances prior to
           the split point is removed.

       D.  Any remaining "RRULE" property has its "COUNT" value adjusted
           by subtracting the number of instances prior to the split
           point.

       E.  The "DTSTART" property of the master instance is adjusted to
           the value of the first instance of the "RRULE" on or after
           the split point, or, in the absence of an "RRULE", to the
           first "RDATE" property value on or after the split point.

   3.  The calendar data in the new resource is modified as follows:

       A.  Any overridden components with a "RECURRENCE-ID" property
           value on or after the split point are removed.

       B.  Any "RDATE" or "EXDATE" property values on or after the split
           point are removed.

       C.  Any "RRULE" property that only generates instances on or
           after the split point is removed.

       D.  Any remaining "RRULE" property has an "UNTIL" value applied,
           with the until value being one second less than the split
           point.

       E.  The "UID" property of all components is changed to (the same)
           new value.

       F.  Attendee participation status MUST NOT be changed.

   4.  The server MUST add a "RELATED" property, with a "RELTYPE"
       parameter set to "X-CALENDARSERVER-RECURRENCE-SET", and with its
       value set to the "UID" property value of the new resource to all
       components of the existing and new resources, if the existing
       resource does not contain a "RELATED" property with a "RELTYPE"
       parameter value set to "X-CALENDARSERVER-RECURRENCE-SET".

   When an organizer splits a scheduled event, the server performs the
   following actions:

   1.  For each attendee hosted on the same server, the server MUST
       split the attendee's copy of the event in accordance with the
       split point used by the organizer.  In doing so, it MUST preserve
       any per-attendee state (alarms, transparency, participation
       status) in the new resource (which also MUST have the same "UID"
       property value as the organizer's new resource).

   2.  For each attendee not hosted on the same server, the server will
       need to send a series of iTIP messages to correctly update the
       attendee with both the modified (old) resource data and the new
       resource.  This will likely result in loss of per-attendee data
       such as alarms (though the participation status might be
       preserved if the calendar user agent processing the new iTIP
       message for the new resource allows it).

   Note that, since attendees can be invited to specific instances of a
   recurring meeting (not necessarily the entire set), it is possible
   that either the old or new calendar data no longer contains any valid



Daboo                                                           [Page 5]

   components since the attendee was not invited to the corresponding
   portions of the original split recurrence.  In such cases, the server
   MUST remove the original resource, or MUST NOT create the new
   resource.

3.1.  Example

   Assume the following iCalendar data is stored in the resource with
   URI "/event.ics":

   The client issues a POST split request to split the recurring event
   at the instance with date-time "20140110T120000Z":

   "20140110T120000Z", and the "COUNT" component of the "RRULE" property
   is adjusted to the value "11" (which represents the number of
   remaining instances for that event, 9 early instances having been
   removed).  The new resource has the original start date-time value,
   and its "RRULE" property has an "UNTIL" value one second prior to the
   split point.  Both resources have a "RELATED" property with a
   "RELTYPE" parameter set to "X-CALENDARSERVER-RECURRENCE-SET" and a
   value set to the "UID" property value of the new resource.


4.  Security Considerations

   This specification does not introduce any more security
   considerations beyond those already listed in iCalendar [RFC5545],
   iTIP [RFC5546] and CalDAV Access [RFC4791] and CalDAV Scheduling
   [RFC6638].


5.  IANA Considerations

   TBD: new HTTP request header registration.
